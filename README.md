# 6_DOF_Robotic_Arm_Simulation
This project involved designing a six degree of freedom robot by writing a URDF XML file, running the robot on the MoveIt Setup Assistant to create the package, use the gazebo_ros controller package to control the robot, Running a script that positions the end effector of the robot to a given position using the generated paths from moveit and finaly Simulate the robot on gazebo and visualize the motion in rviz.
